WARNING:rootpy.interactive.rootwait] unable to access ROOT's GUI thread either because PyROOT's
                finalSetup() was called while in batch mode or because PyROOT
                is using the new PyOS_InputHook-based mechanism that is not yet
                supported in rootpy (PyConfig.StartGuiThread == 'inputhook' or
                gSystem.InheritsFrom('TMacOSXSystem')). wait() etc. will
                instead call raw_input() and wait for [Enter]
