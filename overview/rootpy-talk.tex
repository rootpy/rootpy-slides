    {\bf Why would we even consider developing a layer on top of PyROOT?}
    \end{center}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item PyROOT is mainly bindings with some pythonization.
        \item Certain tasks require awkward code. Same workarounds are
            implemented repetitively by many.
        \item Python's dynamic nature provides many possibilities although not
            currently realized by PyROOT.
        \item There is a lack of integration of ROOT with the vast and growing 
            ecosystem of scientific Python packages.
        \end{itemize}

    \frametitle{rootpy: Design \& Philosophy}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item rootpy does not aim to reproduce ROOT in Python
        but rather provide a layer on top of PyROOT that integrates more
        naturally with Python:
        \vspace{.2cm}
        \begin{itemize}
            \itemsep=.2cm
            \item Setting and getting parameters with simple attributes:\\
                {\bf hist.linecolor = 'darkseagreen'}
            \item Simple navigation through TFiles:\\
                {\bf hist = myfile.somedirectory.otherdirectory.histname}
            \item Support for Python exceptions and logging
            \item Python has a garbage collector but C++ does not: leads to
                strange issues in PyROOT. rootpy addresses these problems.
            \item Arithmetic operators that are otherwise not implemented in
                PyROOT are implemented in rootpy
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
}

\frame{
    \frametitle{rootpy: Design \& Philosophy}

    \begin{itemize}
        \itemsep=.2cm
        \item rootpy classes simply inherit from the corresponding ROOT classes
            and may override methods to add functionality or be decorated with
            additional attributes
        \item rootpy classes typically have the same name as ROOT classes with
            the T removed
            but instead of having many histogram classes rootpy has three: Hist,
            Hist2D, Hist3D with a type argument in the constructor that controls
            which ROOT.THX is inherited from.
        \item Anywhere Python is typically slow (looping) is instead compiled as a C extension
            module. rootpy provides very fast conversion of ROOT Trees into
            NumPy arrays as well as efficiently filling ROOT histograms with
            NumPy arrays.

    \frametitle{The future of rootpy}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Larger documentation coverage. This is important!
        \item More code examples.
        \item Python 3 is becoming more mainstream -- support for this in rootpy
            will be required.
        \item Better integration with the IPython prompt: full tab completion
            and addition of helpful builtin commands like pylab.
        \item Automatic wrapping of ROOT methods by parsing method signatures:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item If a method expects a TColor, rootpy can accept any matplotlib/ROOT color
                      and convert it into a TColor before passing to the ROOT method.
                \item Reduce the amount of code in rootpy.
                \end{itemize}
       \item TMVA:
           \begin{itemize}
                \item Feed TMVA NumPy arrays instead of TTrees. 
                \end{itemize}
       \item RooFit and RooStats:
           \begin{itemize}
                \item Wrap RooArgSet as set() and RooArgList as list()...
                \item Create RooDataSets from NumPy arrays.
                \end{itemize}
   \end{itemize}

    \frametitle{How can I contribute?}
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We use Git! Development is community-driven.
        \item Just fork rootpy into your own GitHub account and:
    
            \hspace{1cm} {\bf git clone git@github.com:[username]/rootpy.git}

              Then submit a pull request with your contribution.
        \item Contributions are reviewed by peers before merging into the main branch.
        \item All new code is automatically tested against our test suite using
            \href{https://travis-ci.org/}{Travis CI}
    \end{itemize}
